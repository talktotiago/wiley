Test Case for Teamshift.

This is not the perfect test case scenario, as the website is taking a good amount ot time to load and therefore it didnt gave me much time to craft it as the way I like it. Such as placing the xpaths in a different file and using Expected Conditions to find elements. As I was in a rush to deliver it today, I used time sleep instead of EC, which I know is not the best way to design the test case, but it was the least time consuming way to deliver it on time. 

At the first test cases I performed, the website crashed before clicking the login button (exception time out) - but in my last 3 attempts, it passed with no problems, although it was time consuming to process the script due the page loading. 

I would also like to take this space to register all of the time and effort that Mr. Shujath took to explain the test cases to me, always going the extra mile to clarify my doubts and help me during the process. He was by a far the best HR manager I have been in contact this year and I appreciate all his hard work to walk me through this process.
